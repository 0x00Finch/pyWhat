# 🤔 `What` is this?

<GIF HERE>

Imagine this: You come across some mysterious text 🧙‍♂️ `5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99` and you wonder what it is. What do you do?

Well, with `what` all you have to do is ask `what "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99"` and `what` will tell you!

`what`'s job is to **identify _what_ something is.** Whether it be a file or text! Or even the hex of a file! What about text _within_ files? We have that too! `what` is recursive, it will identify **everything** in text and more! 

# ⚙ Use Cases

## 🦠 Wannacry

< Use wannacry binary and show a real world example? https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo/blob/master/malwares/Binaries/Ransomware.WannaCry/Ransomware.WannaCry.zip >

You come across a new piece of malware called WantToCry. You think back to Wannacry and remember it was stopped because a researcher found a kill-switch in the code.

When a domain, hardcoded into Wannacry, was registered the virus would stop.

You use `What` to identify all the domains in the malware, and use a domain registrar API to register all the domains. If Wannacry happens again, you can stop it in minutes - not weeks.

## 🦈 Faster Analysis of Pcap files

<GIF OF PCAP HERE>

Say you have a `.pcap` file from a network attack. `What` can identify this and quickly find you:
* All hashes
* Credit card numbers
* Cryptocurrency addresses
* Social Security Numbers
* and much more.

With `what`, you can identify the important things in the pcap in seconds, not minutes.

## 🌌 Anything

Anytime you have a file and you want to find structured data in it that's useful, `What` is for you.

Or if you come across some piece of text and you don't know what it is, `What` will tell you.
